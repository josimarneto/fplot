#fplot
------

Generates plots using python, from data stored in a text file. This file must
include the desired x and y values, which should appear intercalated in lines
(meaning one line containing x values, another y values, another x values,
and so forth). If only one line is to appear in the graphic, then the text
file must include only two lines, the first for x values separated by spaces,
and the second for y values separated also by spaces.

run fplot for help. Documentation is being prepared.
